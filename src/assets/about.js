const aboutMe = `I’m currently a software engineer at Tribe Dynamics developing an influencer data analytics software platform. 
My passion for both creative and technical work means I love collaborating with the product team, understanding the end user, 
implementing designs down to the pixel, and brainstorming edge cases. I have experience with all areas of our tech stack, 
from Django models, through the REST API, to the Vue.js front end.<br><br>
When I’m not coding, I’m in the kitchen meal prepping or baking new recipes to share with my co-workers, planning my next
 trip to a Disney park, or sewing. I’m always down to talk about diversity in tech, new front-end technologies, wearable 
 technology, and boba.
